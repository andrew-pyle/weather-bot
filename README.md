In your browser, you will give the application your ZIP code via
a prompt given, and the browser will go fetch the weather conditions
from an online weather service. Then, the application will determine
what clothing/outfit is suitable for the retrieved weather conditions
(i.e. bring an umbrella, wear a jacket, etc.).
